I'm Javi, a Graphics Engineer and Game Dev from Pamplona 🇪🇸, but currently based in London 🇬🇧.

Being able to create almost anything with what essentially is just an arbitrary arrangement of words is the closer I’ll get to real world magic, and that is why I love programming. ❤️👨🏼‍💻

## 👨🏼‍💻 I'm currently working on...

- A small 3D renderer writen on Swift and Metal. The intention is to use it as a workbench to try different render techniques.
- Rewriting my first game.

## 👀 And I'm also interested in...

- ⚡ Zig
- 🐧 GNU Linux
- 🌋 Vulkan

## ✍🏻 I write too! (from time to time)

- Just about development: [Dev.to](https://dev.to/javiersalcedopuyo)
- But also about things like food recipes and other topics: [Medium](https://javiersalcedo-p.medium.com/)

## 🕰 In the past...

- I worked porting PC games to iOS, Android and macOS
- My first dev career prospect was actually front-end web development, and I even did an internship.
- I studied a bachelors degree on Telecommunications, and my first "real job" was writing tools to process and analyse 5G traffic.
- I also studied a masters degree on video game development, where I found my passion for graphics.
