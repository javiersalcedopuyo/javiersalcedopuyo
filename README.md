I'm Javi, a Graphics Engineer and Game Dev from Pamplona 🇪🇸, but currently based in London 🇬🇧.

Being able to create almost anything with what essentially is just an arbitrary arrangement of words is the closer I’ll get to real world magic, and that is why I love programming. ❤️👨🏼‍💻

## 🕰 In the past...

- My first dev career prospect was actually front-end web development, and I even did an internship.
- I studied a bachelors degree on Telecommunications, and my first "real job" was writing tools to process and analyse 5G traffic.
- I also studied a masters degree on video game development, where I found my passion for graphics.
